In the eighteenth century the German philosopheráImmanuel Kantádeveloped a theory ofáknowledgeáin which knowledge about space can be botháa prioriáandásynthetic.áAccording to Kant, knowledge about space isásynthetic, in that statements about space are not simply true by virtue of the meaning of the words in the statement. In his work, Kant rejected the view that space must be either a substance or relation. Instead he came to the conclusion that space and time are not discovered by humans to be objective features of the world, but imposed by us as part of a framework for organizing experience.
