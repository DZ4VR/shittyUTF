In the seventeenth century, theáphilosophy of space and timeáemerged as a central issue ináepistemologyáandámetaphysics. At its heart,áGottfried Leibniz, the German philosopher-mathematician, andáIsaac Newton, the English physicist-mathematician, set out two opposing theories of what space is. Rather than being an entity that independently exists over and above other matter, Leibniz held that space is no more than the collection of spatial relations between objects in the world: "space is that which results from places taken together".[5]áUnoccupied regions are those thatácouldáhave objects in them, and thus spatial relations with other places. For Leibniz, then, space was an idealisedáabstractionáfrom the relations between individual entities or their possible locations and therefore could not beácontinuousábut must beádiscrete.[6]áSpace could be thought of in a similar way to the relations between family members. Although people in the family are related to one another, the relations do not exist independently of the people.[7]áLeibniz argued that space could not exist independently of objects in the world because that implies a difference between two universes exactly alike except for the location of the material world in each universe. But since there would be no observational way of telling these universes apart then, according to theáidentity of indiscernibles, there would be no real difference between them. According to theáprinciple of sufficient reason, any theory of space that implied that there could be these two possible universes must therefore be wrong.[8]
