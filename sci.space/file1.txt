Spaceáis the boundless three-dimensional extent in whicháobjectsáand events have relative position and direction.[1]áPhysical space is often conceived in threeálinearádimensions, although modernáphysicistsáusually consider it, withátime, to be part of a boundless four-dimensionalácontinuumáknown asáspacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physicaláuniverse. However, disagreement continues betweenáphilosophersáover whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of aáconceptual framework.
