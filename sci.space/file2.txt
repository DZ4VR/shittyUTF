Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises like theáTimaeusáofáPlato, oráSocratesáin his reflections on what the Greeks calledákh?raá(i.e. "space"), or in theáPhysicsáofáAristotleá(Book IV, Delta) in the definition ofátoposá(i.e. place), or in the later "geometrical conception of place" as "spaceáquaáextension" in theáDiscourse on Placeá(Qawl fi al-Makan) of the 11th-century Arab polymatháAlhazen.[2]áMany of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in theáRenaissanceáand then reformulated in the 17th century, particularly during the early development ofáclassical mechanics. InáIsaac Newton's view, space was absoluteŚin the sense that it existed permanently and independently of whether there was any matter in the space.[3]áOtheránatural philosophers, notablyáGottfried Leibniz, thought instead that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects, given by theirádistanceáandádirectionáfrom one another. In the 18th century, the philosopher and theologianáGeorge Berkeleyáattempted to refute the "visibility of spatial depth" in hisáEssay Towards a New Theory of Vision. Later, theámetaphysicianáImmanuel Kantásaid that the concepts of space and time are not empirical ones derived from experiences of the outside worldŚthey are elements of an already given systematic framework that humans possess and use to structure all experiences. Kant referred to the experience of "space" in hisáCritique of Pure Reasonáas being a subjective "pureáa prioriáform of intuition".
